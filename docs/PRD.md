# Capital C - An Open Source Church Management System (ChMS)

### 1. Overview

#### Product Vision

Empower churches of all sizes to manage their people, content, and community
operations through a modular, modern, open-source, cloud-native platform.

#### Mission

To provide a sustainable, extensible, and church-first system for
non-commercial, ethical management of events, people, and custom data ‚Äî while
avoiding invasive financial tracking.

#### Target Audience

- Churches seeking non-commercial, privacy-conscious digital infrastructure
- Administrators wanting a no-code/low-code interface to manage their community
  data
- Developers or volunteers seeking ethical, extensible tooling for faith
  communities

#### Problem Statement

Churches often rely on expensive, proprietary software or piece together
fragmented tools that don't align with their values, especially around money and
privacy.

#### Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

A free, ethical, privacy-first ChMS with multi-tenant architecture, headless-CMS
capabilities, and church-owned data control ‚Äî built to evolve with local needs.

### 2. Goals & Success Metrics

#### Long-Term Vision

A decentralized, open-source ChurchOps platform with strong extensibility,
developer APIs, and ethical defaults that empower rather than monetize
communities.

events, and communications ‚Äî without financial features.

#### Newly Added Post-MVP Enhancements

- Workflow automation (e.g., "When RSVP confirmed, send SMS")
- Bulk messaging segmentation
- Advanced event filters (recurring, per group)
- Public schema-based form + microsite builder
- Developer APIs (REST/GraphQL, scoped keys)

---

### 4. UX & Design Requirements

- Mobile-first and fully responsive design is required for all frontend features
- TailwindCSS-first design system
- Mobile-first, lightweight interface
- Minimal UI chrome ‚Äî content and context focused
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility compliance
- Per-tenant branding: logo, theme, name
- Consider users with varying technical skills

---

### 5. Technical Architecture

- **Stack**: Deno + Fresh (islands), SurrealDB (multi-model, real-time), Zod
  (validation), GraphQL (complex queries)
- **Multi-tenancy**: Tenant-scoped schema, data, and access
- **Auth**: Global users, JWT-based sessions, tenant-scoped permissions
- **RBAC**: Layered (global + church-specific) enforced on DB + API
- **CMS engine**: Schema stored in SurrealDB + rendered dynamically
- **Events & real-time**: Live RSVP updates, status tracking via GraphQL
  subscriptions
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for all data validation and type safety
- **API Design**: REST for simple CRUD, GraphQL for complex relationships
- **Hosting**: Deno Deploy (preferred), fallback to Vercel or Docker

---

### 6. Security & Privacy

- Tenant isolation at schema/query layer
- JWT tokens with short expiry + tenant claims
- Data minimization: No financial tracking or sensitive PII stored unless added
  manually
- Audit logs: Track access + data changes per user
- GDPR-ready: Data export, deletion, opt-in consent
- Implement tenant isolation at all layers
- Use secure authentication (passwordless preferred)

---

### 7. Development Plan

#### Release Strategy

- Alpha ‚Äì Internal use + docs
- Beta ‚Äì Invite-only onboarding for small churches
- Stable v1.0 ‚Äì Public launch with schema builder, core CMS, and events

#### Community Onboarding

- CONTRIBUTING.md with testable issues
- Discord + GitHub Discussions
- CLI for spinning up test church instances
